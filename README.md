# StatMeanderpy

StatMeanderpy is a deriviation of Meanderpy (https://github.com/zsylvester/meanderpy) developed by Zolt√°n Sylvester, which  implements a simple numerical model of meandering, the one described by Howard & Knutson in their 1984 paper "Sufficient Conditions for River Meandering: A Simulation Approach" (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR020i011p01659).
