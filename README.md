# StatMeanderpy

StatMeanderpy is a deriviation of Meanderpy (https://github.com/zsylvester/meanderpy) developed by Zolt√°n Sylvester, which  implements a simple numerical model of river meandering, the one described by Howard & Knutson in their 1984 paper ["Sufficient Conditions for River Meandering: A Simulation Approach"](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR020i011p01659).

River migration can be predicted using a similar approach to weather forecasting. By employing probabilistic modeling techniques, we have developed MCMC-based river migration risk maps. For more details, you can refer to our [EGU paper here](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-17240.html) conference paper here.
